## Utilities
This section lists utilities and installation instructions for specific utilities. This is not necessarily an all-inclusive list, and not all of the utilities may be available, useful, or compatible with your specific camera. These instuctions assume that the hack is already correctly installed. 

### nanotts
This utility can provide text-to-speech capability for supported cameras. Decompress this into the `yi-hack` directory on the SD card. For Allwinner-v2, for example, nonotts would end up in `/tmp/sd/yi-hack/bin` if using FTP, or in `/yi-hack/bin` if accessing the SD card directly.

## DISCLAIMER
**NOBODY BUT YOU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USE OR DAMAGE THIS SOFTWARE MAY CAUSE. THIS IS INTENDED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
